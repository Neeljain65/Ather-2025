# Aether 2025 Project Instructions

This project is a modern, futuristic landing page for Aether 2025 - a national-level technical conference at TCET Mumbai.

## Project Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui components
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Design**: Modern, tech-inspired design with gradients and cosmic elements
- **Background**: White with blue gradients and yellow/orange accents

## Development Guidelines

### Design Principles
- Maintain the futuristic, cosmic theme throughout
- Use smooth gradients (deep blue â†’ lighter blue) with yellow/orange accents
- Include decorative elements like stars, sparkles, and abstract shapes
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Keep animations smooth and performant

### Component Structure
- Each major section is a separate component in `src/components/sections/`
- Components use Framer Motion for animations
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
- Consistent gradient and color schemes across components

### Code Standards
- TypeScript for type safety
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Accessible design patterns
- Optimized performance with Next.js features
